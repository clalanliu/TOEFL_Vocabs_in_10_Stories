Infantile resistance to new experiences is a key aspect of early development, particularly in the realm of perception and memory. As researchers explore the frontality of an infant’s gaze, they assess how the architecture of the infant's lungs supports their breath, especially during a yawn, a physiological action that reflects both automatic and metabolic processes regulated by the diaphragm.

嬰兒對新經驗的抗拒是早期發展中的一個關鍵方面，特別是在感知和記憶的領域。隨著研究人員探索嬰兒注視的正面性，他們也在評估嬰兒肺部的結構如何支持其呼吸，尤其是在打哈欠時。打哈欠是一種反映自動化和代謝過程的生理動作，這些過程由橫膈膜調控。

This early period of life is critical for understanding how infants encode and reproduce physical stimuli. For instance, the structure of perceptual memory in infants is akin to a geometric pattern woven together, much like the ritualistic creation of earthenware and porcelain by aboriginal cultures. These ancient practices, steeped in supernatural significance, share parallels with how infants process and project their early experiences.

這段生命的早期階段對理解嬰兒如何編碼和再現物理刺激至關重要。例如，嬰兒的感知記憶結構類似於編織在一起的幾何圖案，就像原住民文化中儀式性創作的陶器和瓷器一樣。這些古老的實踐充滿了超自然的意義，與嬰兒處理和展現其早期經驗的方式有相似之處。

Artifacts such as statues, paintings, and photographs serve as historical records, much like the kinetoscope, which captures sequences of motion. These objects are exhibited in theaters, where films reproduce dimensional projections, offering a glimpse into the collective memory of humanity. The diaphragmatic actions in infants, similar to respiratory patterns observed in the theater, highlight the intersection of physiological function and cultural expression.

雕像、繪畫和照片等文物作為歷史記錄，類似於捕捉動作序列的活動電影放映機（如活動電影機）。這些物件在劇院中展出，電影再現了立體投影，提供了人類集體記憶的一瞥。嬰兒的橫膈膜動作與劇院中觀察到的呼吸模式類似，突顯了生理功能與文化表達的交集。

The concept of amnesia, particularly in how it relates to perceptual memory, is crucial in understanding how infants develop their sense of self and environment. This understanding can be compared to the architectural designs of aboriginal structures, which serve both functional and symbolic purposes. The weave of these cultural and physical elements forms the foundation for an infant's perceptual and cognitive development, much like how a manuscript encodes knowledge, preserving it for future generations.

健忘的概念，尤其是與感知記憶的關聯，對於理解嬰兒如何發展其自我和環境感知至關重要。這種理解可以與原住民建築的設計相比較，這些設計既具功能性又具有象徵意義。這些文化和物理元素的編織構成了嬰兒感知和認知發展的基礎，就像手稿編碼知識一樣，為未來世代保留。
