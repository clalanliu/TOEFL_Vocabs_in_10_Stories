The terrestrial planets, such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, are primarily composed of rocky matter and have extensive geological activities. Venus, with its thick, greenhouse-gas-filled atmosphere, experiences intense volcanic activity, causing significant outflows and creating vast highlands and channels. The vapor in Venus's atmosphere contributes to its dense cloud cover and harsh surface conditions. Mars, our neighboring planet, shows evidence of ancient runoff channels, hinting at the presence of liquid water in its past. Martian geological features also include dormant volcanoes and extensive craters.

類地行星，如水星、金星、地球和火星，主要由岩石物質組成，並有廣泛的地質活動。金星擁有濃厚的溫室氣體大氣層，經歷著強烈的火山活動，造成了大量熔岩流，並形成了廣闊的高地和通道。金星大氣中的水汽促成了其濃密的雲層和惡劣的表面條件。火星，我們的鄰居行星，顯示出古代流水通道的證據，暗示著過去存在液態水。火星的地質特徵還包括休眠的火山和廣泛的隕石坑。

The atmosphere of Venus also contains ejecta from volcanic eruptions, contributing to its dense, cloud-covered sky. This atmospheric composition is vastly different from the gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. These Jovian planets have a thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere with a massive gravitational pull that retains their gaseous envelopes. Jupiter's gravity also influences its many satellites, creating a complex system of moons with varied geological and atmospheric phenomena.
